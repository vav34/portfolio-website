            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This video essay introduces the phenomenon of anime watchers struggling to move on from Attack on Titan by Hajime Isayama. Why do so many fans find it difficult to transition to a new anime after completing the series? I aim to tackle this question by drawing parallels between the audience’s emotional detachment from other series and Mikasa’s profound loneliness at the story’s conclusion. Additionally, I highlight how Attack on Titan differs drastically from other shows in its genre, reinforcing the idea that Isayama’s meticulous storytelling may have intentionally created this lingering emotional effect.</p>
            <p>Utilizing the video essay format allowed me to blend analytical commentary with carefully selected visuals, reinforcing the themes I explored. Through dynamic editing in Premiere Pro, I structured my argument using layered clips, still imagery, and voiceover narration to create an engaging, cohesive narrative. The medium enabled me to emphasize not just the intellectual aspects of the discussion but also the emotional weight that Attack on Titan carries for its audience. Unlike a traditional written essay, this format allowed me to present visual and auditory evidence that made my points more immersive and persuasive.</p>
            <p>My engagement with ongoing conversations about Attack on Titan was essential to shaping my analysis. By exploring fan discussions, analytical essays, and critical reviews, I gained a broader understanding of the series' impact on its audience. Peer and instructor feedback played a crucial role in refining my thesis and ensuring my points were well-articulated and clearly supported by evidence. Their perspectives encouraged me to strengthen my argument, clarify certain connections, and enhance the overall flow of my video essay.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on this process, I found that both the research and technical aspects of editing pushed me to refine my approach to media analysis. Using Premiere Pro to structure my argument visually and audibly deepened my appreciation for the power of video essays as a storytelling tool. This project not only enhanced my analytical skills but also reaffirmed the depth and intentionality of Isayama’s storytelling—leaving both his characters and his audience forever changed.</p>
