        <h2>The Website Making Process</h2>
        <p>While making this website, I wanted to organize things using html and css to offer a concise experience that was easy to navigate. It includes a home page, a projects page, and a page for both my audio narrative and video essay. This format made the most sense to me logically, so that's why I chose to organize it in this way. </p>
        <p>It took some troubleshooting, but with enough practice I was able to comfortably add images, audio, and href links to my site. This allowed me to link my projects, credits, and images pertaining to each project as well as attractive images for my homepage.</p>
        <p>For styling, I used CSS to alter colors, formatting, and typography. I was aiming for more of a minimalist style, encorporating pastel blues, pinks, and white. I also wanted to make sure the images I included didn't clash with these colors. I also incorporated my favorite font ever, Lora, (I know I'm such a nerd for having a favorite font) which gave it the final touches.</p>
        <p>The programs I used to design and showcase this website were Visual Studio Code and GitHub. I used VSC to code the website and GitHub to organize my files, commit and push changes, and make my website viewable for my peers and instructor.</p>
        <p>Overall, I had so much fun creating this website, as well as my audio narrative and video essay. First, the audio narrative allowed me to explore podcasting and really came in handy when I had to make a podcast for another class this semester. The video essay was the most fun for me because I've always really been interested in creating video essays. Lastly, the website allowed me to organize (one of my favorite activities ever) and compose an easy-to-navigate basis in which I could link each of my other projects. I am super appreciative for everything this class taught me and look forward to using the skills I learned in the future.</p>
